- Primary "black": this can be absolute black, but a lot of websites often don't use absolute black to achieve a more gentler look. This is often more the most important info like header
- Secondary "black": this will be lighter than the absolute black. The font that uses this color lightly also is also for important info but that you don't distract users from the primary black. In this case it's the stats.
- Light grey: this can be used for borders, such as div border or break lines. Google.com uses this a lot if you want to check it out. We will be using this for border
- And super light grey: this super light grey will be much lighter than the light grey above. We are using a super light grey as the background color to demarcate the cards. The user will be subconsciously drawn to the white card itself without being distracted by the contrast, therefore focusing on the primary and secondary black front that you carefully laid out before.
- Besides picking different shades of black, you can also pick a primary color to not only provide a theme and identity of your application, but also to guide your user's visual attention (e.g. blue is the primary color for Facebook). This primary color can be used to highlight additional titles, navbar items and buttons.

Similar to different shades of "black" that we discussed earlier, you can have different shades off your primary color to guide your user's visual attention. When applying this to buttons, for example, you might want to use your primary blue as solid background color for important button, such as "submit", but use your lighter, secondary blue for a less important button, "cancel".
